# Predict_Auto_MPG

This project involves exploratory data analysis and data preparation on Auto MPG Data set(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG). Then two ML models have been trained and the model with better performace has been fine-tuned to improve performance. Finally, the final trained model is deployed on Heroku via a Flask app.
